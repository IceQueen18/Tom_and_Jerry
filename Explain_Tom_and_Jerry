This game is like an upgraded version of Hunt the Wumpus—but with a Tom and Jerry twist! The challenge is even harder because the layout of the rooms changes dynamically. For example, if you enter Room 24 and hear barking, you can leave and return, but Room 24 will never be the same. Each time, it could present a new obstacle or opportunity.

The Goal:
Help Jerry the mouse get to the cheese in the fridge!

The Challenges:
Jerry has two main obstacles:

Tom the Cat, who’s always on the prowl.
A room full of mouse traps, which could stop Jerry in his tracks.
The Ally:
Jerry’s only helper is the Dog. If Jerry finds him, the Dog can provide a shortcut to the fridge. But beware—if Jerry chooses the wrong path, he’ll end up back at the starting point!

Can you outsmart Tom, dodge the traps, and help Jerry reach the cheese?
